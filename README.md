# Intrernship Report Ayoub EL HOUDRI

In the summer of 2021, I did an internship at Digimind Labs in Berlin office. This internship included training by top engineers and researchers about how to use the tooling for the daily engineer workflow as well as a real-world project. The real-world project concerned 3D shape reconstruction from a single 2D pre-processed image.

This report contains an overall impression of the working environment at Digimind Labs, a description of the full internship, the technical aspects of the task that was given as well as an insight in the way Digimind leverage AI to make packaging sustainable by design.
